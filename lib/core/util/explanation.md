You're looking at a .dart file that defines a custom exception class and a mixin for validating HTTP responses within your application.

Here's a detailed technical explanation of this file:

1. AppException Class:

class AppException { ... }: This declares a simple class named AppException. This class is intended to represent application-specific exceptions.
final String message;: This declares a final property named message of type String. This property will hold a descriptive message about the exception.
AppException({this.message = 'Sorry, something went wrong'});: This is the constructor for the AppException class.
{this.message = 'Sorry, something went wrong'}: This uses named parameters with a default value. It allows you to create an AppException instance with an optional custom message. If no message is provided, it defaults to 'Sorry, something went wrong'. The this.message syntax in the constructor is shorthand for assigning the value of the message parameter to the message property of the class instance.
Purpose of AppException:

The AppException class provides a standardized way to represent errors that occur within your application's logic, particularly those related to data fetching or processing. By using a custom exception class, you can:

Distinguish application errors from other types of errors: This makes error handling more specific and allows you to react differently to application errors compared to, for example, system errors or network errors.
Provide meaningful error messages: The message property allows you to include context-specific information about what went wrong.
Improve code readability: Using throw AppException(...) clearly indicates that an application-level error has occurred.
2. Imports:

import 'package:danter/core/util/exceptions.dart';: This line imports the current file itself. This is likely done to make the AppException class available within the mixin defined later in the same file.
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';: This imports the dio package, which is an HTTP client for Dart. The Response class, used in the mixin, comes from this package.
3. HttpResponseValidat Mixin:

mixin HttpResponseValidat { ... }: This declares a mixin named HttpResponseValidat. A mixin is a way to reuse code in multiple class hierarchies. When you "mix in" HttpResponseValidat to a class, that class gains access to the methods defined in the mixin.
validatResponse(Response response) { ... }: This defines a method named validatResponse within the mixin. It takes a Response object as input.
if (response.statusCode != 200) { ... }: This is the core logic of the method. It checks the statusCode property of the Response object. The status code 200 typically indicates a successful HTTP request.
throw AppException();: If the statusCode is not equal to 200, it throws a new instance of the AppException class with the default message.
Purpose of HttpResponseValidat:

The HttpResponseValidat mixin provides a reusable way to validate HTTP responses. It encapsulates the common logic of checking for a successful status code and throwing a standardized application exception if the response indicates an error.

How the mixin is used:

Mixins are used with the with keyword when defining a class. For example:

class MyDataSource with HttpResponseValidat {
  // ... other methods ...

  Future<SomeData> fetchData() async {
    try {
      Response response = await dio.get('/some/endpoint');
      validatResponse(response); // Use the mixin method to validate

      // Process successful response data
      // ...
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle AppException or other errors
      if (e is AppException) {
        // Handle application-specific error
      } else {
        // Handle other errors
      }
      rethrow; // Re-throw the exception if needed
    }
  }
}


By mixing in HttpResponseValidat, the MyDataSource class gains the validatResponse method without having to duplicate the validation logic in every method that makes an HTTP request.

In summary, this file provides:

A custom exception class (AppException) for representing application-level errors.
A mixin (HttpResponseValidat) for easily validating HTTP responses and throwing an AppException if the response status code is not 200.
This approach promotes consistency in error handling and reduces code duplication when dealing with HTTP responses in your application.
