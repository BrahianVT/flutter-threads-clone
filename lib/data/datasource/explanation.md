These .dart files in the lib/data/datasource directory are responsible for interacting with data sources, specifically PocketBase, to perform various operations related to authentication, messaging, user status, posts, replies, and user search. They abstract the data fetching and manipulation logic away from the rest of the application, following a common architectural pattern (like a repository pattern).

Here's a detailed technical explanation of each file, with special attention to how PocketBase is being used:

This file defines the data source for authentication-related operations.

IAuthDataSource Abstract Class: This class defines the contract for authentication data sources. It declares two abstract methods:

login(String username, String password): This method is responsible for authenticating a user with a username and password.
singUp(String username, String password, String passwordConfirm): This method is responsible for registering a new user with a username, password, and password confirmation.
AuthRemoteDataSource Class: This class implements the IAuthDataSource interface and interacts with a remote data source (PocketBase) using the Dio HTTP client. It also uses a HttpResponseValidat mixin, which is likely a custom mixin for validating HTTP responses.

Constructor: It takes a Dio instance as a dependency for making HTTP requests.
login Method:
It makes a POST request to the collections/users/auth-with-password endpoint of the PocketBase API. This endpoint is specifically designed for authenticating users using their username/email and password.
The request body contains a map with identity (username) and password.
It calls validatResponse to check if the HTTP response is successful.
If the response is valid, it parses the JSON response data into an AuthInfo object using AuthInfo.fromJson and returns it. The AuthInfo object likely contains information about the authenticated user, such as their ID, token, and other profile data.
singUp Method:
It makes a POST request to the collections/users/records endpoint of the PocketBase API to create a new user record.
The request body contains a map with username, password, and passwordConfirm.
It calls validatResponse to validate the response.
After successfully creating the user record, it calls the login method with the new username and password to automatically log in the newly registered user.
PocketBase Usage:

The AuthRemoteDataSource directly interacts with PocketBase's REST API endpoints for user authentication (auth-with-password) and user creation (collections/users/records).
It leverages PocketBase's built-in authentication mechanism by sending user credentials to the designated endpoint.
It relies on PocketBase to handle the hashing and verification of passwords securely.
This file handles data operations related to messaging and real-time chat functionality, heavily utilizing PocketBase's real-time subscriptions.

IchatDataSource Abstract Class: Defines the interface for chat data sources, including methods for fetching messages, sending messages, managing chat rooms, and handling real-time updates. It also defines streams and getters for accessing chat data.

ChatRemoteDataSource Class: Implements IchatDataSource and interacts with PocketBase.

Constructor: Takes Dio and PocketBase instances. Dio is used for standard HTTP requests, while PocketBase is used for real-time subscriptions.
Private Members:
_chat, _chatuser: Lists to hold fetched messages.
_chatuseronline: Boolean to track the online status of a chat user.
_streamControllerListMessages, _streamControllerChatuser, _streamControllerUseronline: Stream controllers for broadcasting updates to listeners.
Streams and Getters: Provide public access to the private data lists and streams.
realtime(String userId):
Subscribes to real-time updates on the chat collection in PocketBase using pb.collection('chat').subscribe('*', ...) . The * indicates listening to all events (create, update, delete) on this collection.
When an event occurs, it calls getListMessages(userId) to refresh the list of messages for the current user. This ensures the message list is updated in real-time as new messages are sent or existing ones are modified/deleted.
getListMessages(String userId):
Fetches a list of chat messages from the chat collection.
Uses dio.get to make an HTTP GET request.
The queryParameters are crucial for filtering and expanding data:
'filter': 'usersend="$userId" || usersseen="$userId"': Filters messages to include those where the current user is either the sender or the receiver.
'expand': 'usersend,usersseen': This tells PocketBase to expand the related usersend and usersseen fields, retrieving the full user records instead of just their IDs. This is essential for displaying sender and receiver information in the UI.
'sort': '-created': Sorts the messages by creation date in descending order (newest first).
'perPage': 500: Sets the maximum number of results per page.
Parses the response data into a list of MessagesList objects.
Adds a true value to the _streamControllerListMessages sink to notify listeners that the message list has been updated.
getchatuser(String myuserid, String useridchat):
Fetches messages exchanged between two specific users.
The filter parameter ensures messages are included only if they are between myuserid and useridchat in either direction.
Similar to getListMessages, it expands the user records and sorts by creation date.
Returns a list of MessagesList objects.
realtimeuser(String myuserid, String useridchat):
Subscribes to real-time updates on the chat collection, similar to realtime.
When an event occurs, it adds a true value to _streamControllerChatuser to notify listeners that there might be new messages in the current chat.
addChat(String usersend, String userseen, String text, String roomid):
Sends a new chat message by creating a new record in the chat collection.
Uses FormData to send the message data as a POST request.
Includes the sender ID (usersend), receiver ID (userseen), message text (text), and roomid (likely for grouping messages in a conversation).
addRooomId(String user1, String user2):
Creates a new record in a roomid collection (likely used to manage conversations between two users).
Returns the ID of the newly created room record.
realtimeuseronline(String userId):
Subscribes to real-time updates for a specific user record in the users collection using pb.collection('users').subscribe(userId, ...). This is used to track the online status of a particular user.
When the user's record is updated, it checks the online field in the updated record's data and updates the _chatuseronline variable.
Notifies listeners via _streamControllerUseronline.
getchatuseronline(String useridchat):
Fetches the online status of a specific user by getting their record from the users collection.
Updates _chatuseronline and notifies listeners.
Returns the online status.
closechatScreen() and closeMessagesList(): Methods to close the respective stream controllers to prevent memory leaks when the corresponding screens are closed.
PocketBase Usage:

Extensive use of PocketBase's real-time subscriptions (pb.collection(...).subscribe(...)) to enable instant updates for message lists and user online status.
Interacts with PocketBase collections (chat, users, roomid) using HTTP requests (via Dio) for fetching, creating, and updating records.
Leverages PocketBase's filtering (filter) and expanding (expand) capabilities in queries to efficiently retrieve and relate data.
Uses PocketBase's built-in sorting (sort) for ordering messages chronologically.
This file is responsible for updating the online status of the current user based on the application's lifecycle.

OnlineUserUatasource Class: Implements WidgetsBindingObserver to listen for changes in the application's lifecycle state.
Constructor: Takes Dio and the current user's userid.
online() Method:
Makes a PATCH request to update the user's record in the users collection in PocketBase.
Sets the online field to true.
didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state): This is a method from WidgetsBindingObserver that is called when the application's lifecycle state changes.
If the state is AppLifecycleState.inactive (app is in the background), it sets the user's online status to false in PocketBase.
If the state is AppLifecycleState.resumed (app is in the foreground), it sets the user's online status back to true.
PocketBase Usage:

Uses PATCH requests to update a specific user record in the users collection to reflect their online status.
Relies on PocketBase to store and manage the online status for each user.
This file handles data operations related to posts, likes, follows, and user profiles.

IPostDataSource Abstract Class: Defines the interface for post-related data sources with methods for fetching posts, sending posts, managing likes and follows, retrieving user information, and handling replies.

PostRemoteDataSource Class: Implements IPostDataSource and interacts with PocketBase using Dio and PocketBase.

Constructor: Takes Dio and PocketBase instances. Dio for most requests, PocketBase for specific operations like deleting a post.
getPost(String userId):
Fetches posts from the post collection, excluding posts by the current user and filtering by a specific category ('ykbdovmvv3qf66l'). The category likely distinguishes main posts from replies.
Expands related fields: user (the author of the post), replies.user (the users who replied to the post), and postid.user (the user of the post that a reply is associated with - relevant for replies, though this method fetches main posts).
Sorts by creation date.
Returns a list of PostEntity objects.
getPostProfile(String userId):
Fetches posts created by a specific user ('user ="$userId"') and filtered by the main post category.
Expands related users and sorts.
Returns a list of PostEntity objects.
sendPost(String userId, String text, image):
Creates a new post record in the post collection.
Uses FormData to send the post data, including the user ID, category, text content, and potentially multiple image files. The image files are prepared as MultipartFile for uploading.
addLike(String userId, String postid):
Adds a user's ID to the likes field of a specific post record using a PATCH request. The likes+ syntax is a PocketBase-specific way to add an item to a list field.
deleteLike(String userId, String postid):
Removes a user's ID from the likes field of a post using a PATCH request with the likes- syntax.
addfollow(String myuserId, String userIdProfile):
Adds myuserId to the followers list of userIdProfile and userIdProfile to the following list of myuserId using PATCH requests with the + syntax. This represents a mutual follow relationship.
deleteFollow(String myuserId, String userIdProfile):
Removes the follower/following relationship using PATCH requests with the - syntax.
getAllLikePost(String postId):
Fetches a post record and expands the likes field to get the full user records of those who liked the post.

geAllfollowers(String userId) and geAllfollowing(String userId):
Fetch a user record and expand the followers and following fields respectively to get the full user records of followers and following.
Return lists of Followers and Following objects (likely models representing users in those relationships).
deletePost(String postid):
Deletes a post record from the post collection using pb.collection('post').delete(postid). This demonstrates using the PocketBase SDK directly for simple delete operations.
sendNameAndBio(String userid, String name, String bio):
Updates a user's name and bio fields in their user record using a PATCH request.
Returns the updated User object.
sendImagePorofile(String userid, image):
Updates a user's avatar field in their user record.
Uses FormData and MultipartFile to upload the profile image.
Returns the updated User object.
getReply(String userId):
Fetches records from the post collection that are replies ('category =\"oevvz5ic1r1garf\"') created by a specific user and are associated with a parent post ('postid != ""').
Expands related users and the parent post's user.
Returns a list of PostEntity objects (representing replies).
getReplyPost(String postId):
Fetches records from the post collection that are replies ('postid =\"$postId\"') to a specific parent post.
Expands related users and the parent post's user.
Returns a list of PostEntity objects (representing replies to a post).
getPostReply(String postId):
Fetches a specific post record by its ID, likely to get the details of the parent post for a reply.
Expands related users and replies.
Returns a list containing a single PostEntity object (the parent post).
getAllReply(String userId):
A more complex method that first fetches all replies by a user (getReply).
Then, for each reply, it fetches the corresponding parent post (getPostReply).
Combines the reply and its parent post into PostReply objects and returns a list of these.
removeFollow(String myuserId, String userIdProfile):
Removes the follower/following relationship using PATCH requests with the - syntax. (Note: This seems to duplicate the functionality of deleteFollow, which might indicate redundant code or a slightly different use case not clear from the code alone).
getUser(String userId):
Fetches a specific user record by ID.
Returns a User object.
getAllUser(String userId):
Fetches all user records except the current user.
Returns a list of User objects.
getSearchUser(String keyuserName, String userId):

Returns a list of matching User objects.
PocketBase Usage:

Extensive use of PocketBase's REST API for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on post and users collections.
Leverages filtering (filter) and expanding (expand) in GET requests to retrieve specific data and related records efficiently.
Uses PocketBase's list modification operators (+, -) in PATCH requests for adding or removing items from list fields (like likes, followers, following, replies).
Utilizes FormData and MultipartFile for uploading files (images) to PocketBase.
Employs PocketBase's built-in search functionality (~ operator in filter).
This file focuses specifically on data operations related to post replies.

IReplyDataSource Abstract Class: Defines the interface for reply data sources with methods for fetching replies, sending replies, and linking replies to parent posts.

ReplyRemoteDataSource Class: Implements IReplyDataSource and interacts with PocketBase using Dio.

Constructor: Takes a Dio instance.

Expands the user field to get the author of the reply.
Sorts by creation date.
Returns a list of PostEntity objects (representing replies).
sendPostReply(String userId, String text, String postid, image):
Creates a new post record in the post collection to represent a reply.
Sets the postid field to the ID of the parent post and the category to 'oevvz5ic1r1garf' (indicating it's a reply).
Uses FormData to send the reply data, including the user ID, text, parent post ID, and any attached images.
Returns the ID of the newly created reply record.
sendidReplyToPost(String idReply, String postId):
Updates the parent post record (identified by postId) by adding the ID of the newly created reply (idReply) to its replies list using a PATCH request with the replies+ syntax. This establishes the link between the parent post and the reply.
PocketBase Usage:

Interacts with the post collection for creating and fetching reply records.
Uses filtering (filter) to retrieve replies associated with a specific parent post.
Employs PATCH requests with the + operator to add reply IDs to the replies list of the parent post.
Uses FormData and MultipartFile for sending reply data with images.
This file handles user search functionality, but it appears to be using a local data source (hive) rather than PocketBase for storing recent search history.

ISearchUserDatasource Abstract Class: Defines the interface for user search data sources, including methods for adding, retrieving, deleting, and clearing search history.

SearchUserLocalDatasource Class: Implements ISearchUserDatasource and uses the hive_flutter package for local data storage.

box = Hive.box<User>('Search'): Opens a Hive box named 'Search' to store User objects. Hive is a fast, lightweight, and easy-to-use NoSQL database for Dart and Flutter.
addSearchUser(User user): Adds a User object to the 'Search' Hive box.
getAllSearchUser(): Retrieves all User objects stored in the 'Search' Hive box.
deleteSearchUser(User user): Deletes a specific User object from the Hive box using its key.
deleteAllSearchUser(): Deletes all entries from the 'Search' Hive box.
PocketBase Usage:

None: This data source exclusively uses Hive for local storage and does not directly interact with PocketBase. The actual user search logic (fetching users based on a search query from PocketBase) is likely implemented in PostRemoteDataSource.getSearchUser, and this SearchUserLocalDatasource is used for managing the recent search history locally.
In summary, the .dart files in lib/data/datasource demonstrate a clear separation of concerns, with each file focusing on a specific area of data interaction. They extensively utilize PocketBase's REST API for various operations, including authentication, data fetching with filtering and expanding, real-time subscriptions for instant updates, and file uploads. The search_user_source.dart file stands out as it uses a local database (Hive) for managing search history, complementing the remote PocketBase data source for the actual user search queries.
