The files in lib/screen/auth/bloc represent the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern implementation for the authentication screen. BLoC is a state management pattern that helps separate the presentation layer (UI) from the business logic. It uses streams to manage the flow of events and states.

Here's a detailed technical explanation of each file:

This file defines the events that can occur in the authentication screen. Events are inputs to the BLoC, typically triggered by user interactions.

AuthEvent Abstract Class: This is the base class for all authentication events. It extends Equatable from the equatable package, which helps in comparing objects for equality. This is useful in BLoC for determining if the state has changed.
AuthStarted: This event is likely dispatched when the authentication screen is initialized. It could be used to perform any initial setup or checks.
AuthButtonIsClicked: This event is dispatched when the authentication button (login or signup) is clicked by the user. It carries the user's input: username, password, and passwordConfirm. The passwordConfirm is only relevant for the signup process.
AuthModeChangeIsClicked: This event is dispatched when the user switches between login and signup modes (e.g., by tapping a "Switch to Signup" button).
Role in BLoC:

Events represent the actions or inputs that the BLoC needs to process.
The BLoC receives these events and reacts to them by performing business logic and emitting new states.
This file defines the different states that the authentication screen can be in. States are the outputs of the BLoC, representing the current condition of the UI.

AuthState Abstract Class: This is the base class for all authentication states. It also extends Equatable. It includes a isLoginMode property to indicate whether the current state is for the login or signup mode.
AuthInitial: Represents the initial state of the authentication screen. It indicates whether the screen is currently in login or signup mode.
AuthError: Represents a state where an error has occurred during the authentication process. It includes an AppException object to provide details about the error.
AuthLoading: Represents a state where the authentication process is in progress (e.g., waiting for a response from the server). This state is typically used to show a loading indicator in the UI.
AuthSuccess: Represents a state where the authentication process has been successful.
Role in BLoC:

States represent the different UI configurations based on the application's state.
The UI observes these states and updates itself accordingly.
This file contains the core logic of the authentication BLoC. It processes the incoming events and emits the corresponding states.

AuthBloc Class: This class extends Bloc<AuthEvent, AuthState>, indicating that it takes AuthEvent as input and produces AuthState as output.
authRepository: An instance of IAuthRepository is injected into the BLoC. This demonstrates the dependency on the repository layer for performing authentication operations. The BLoC interacts with the repository, not directly with the data source.
isLoginMode: A boolean variable to keep track of the current authentication mode (login or signup).
Constructor: Initializes the BLoC with an IAuthRepository and an initial isLoginMode. It sets the initial state to AuthInitial.
on<AuthEvent>((event, emit) async { ... }): This is the core of the BLoC's event handling. It defines how the BLoC reacts to different AuthEvent types. The emit function is used to dispatch new states.
try...catch Block: The event handling is wrapped in a try...catch block to handle potential exceptions that might occur during the authentication process (e.g., network errors, invalid credentials).
if (event is AuthButtonIsClicked):
When the authentication button is clicked, the BLoC first emits AuthLoading to indicate that an operation is in progress.
It then checks the isLoginMode:
If in login mode, it calls authRepository.login with the provided username and password.
If in signup mode, it calls authRepository.signUp with the username, password, and password confirmation.
If the repository call is successful, it emits AuthSuccess.
else if (event is AuthModeChangeIsClicked):
When the mode change button is clicked, it toggles the isLoginMode flag.
It then emits AuthInitial with the new isLoginMode to update the UI to the other authentication mode.
catch (e): If any exception occurs during the processing of AuthButtonIsClicked, it catches the exception and emits AuthError, providing the error details.
Role in BLoC:

The BLoC is the central piece that connects events and states.
It contains the business logic for authentication, orchestrating the interaction with the AuthRepository.
It manages the state transitions based on user actions and the results of asynchronous operations (like API calls through the repository).
How it uses the Repository (and indirectly PocketBase):

The AuthBloc relies on the IAuthRepository to perform the actual authentication operations (login and signUp). It does not have direct knowledge of how the repository fetches or persists data. This is a key aspect of the repository pattern â€“ the BLoC is decoupled from the data source implementation details.

The AuthRepository, as explained previously, in turn uses the IAuthDataSource (specifically AuthRemoteDataSource) to communicate with the PocketBase API. Therefore, the BLoC indirectly interacts with PocketBase through the repository and data source layers.

The BLoC's responsibility is to handle the presentation logic related to authentication: responding to button clicks, showing loading indicators, displaying error messages, and navigating to the next screen upon success. It delegates the complex task of interacting with the backend (PocketBase) to the repository and data source.

This architecture with BLoC, Repository, and Data Source layers promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability of the application.
